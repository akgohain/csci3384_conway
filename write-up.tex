\section{Introduction: Can Life be Simulated?}
  \textit{That is the question, isn't it.} For centuries, mathematicians, philosophers, Computer scientists, have spent their lives trying to uncover what it means to truly be alive. Many come together, often crossing their respective disciplines to construct answers to these larger, often existential questions. Even today, humanity has continued to develop complicated technology in hopes of understanding more about life, how it can be studied, and possibly even synthesized.
\
\textit{What is life?} Back in 1940, John Von Neumann and Stanislaw Ulam set out to prove an answer to this very question. Von Neumann was an American Mathematician whose research focused on self-replicating systems and cellular automata. Alongside his colleague Ulam, who worked together with Von Neumann on the Manhattan Project, they proposed a simple discrete game that replicated life. Their mathematical model consisted of a two-dimensional grid of square cells, where the state of the next generation of cells would depend on the interaction between living cells and their neighbors(citation). They called it \textit{The Universal Constructor} which produced fascinating properties of time and space usage. 

Not long after their proposal, a British Mathematician known as John Conway extended upon Ulam and Von Neumann’s research to fabricate an instance of their Universal Constructor that better replicated Alan Turing’s “universal computer”. By experimenting with different rules and states between neighboring automata, Conway was able to simplify the model into a game that was only composed of only a few basic rules.(Citation)[see section (CITE SECTION)]. 
\
Shortly after, in 1970, the \textit{Scientific American} published an article articulating how to play the game which resulted in the greatest number of letters reactions from readers at that time (citation). In the paper, Conway proposed that no initial pattern could grow without limit, and offered fifty dollars to the first person who could disprove him by the end of the year (citation). This catalyzed immense popularity in the game, and set forth the many mathematical discoveries that have now been proven about the game, such as its undecidable nature (see section (CITE SECTION)), and recurring patterns(see section).

\subsection{The Game}
Simularly to how Alan Turing proposed models of computation prior to the construction of what we know today as a computer, the specfic rules and methods of playing of Conway's Game of Life, predated any deep techonolgocal expcation of the future. 

Very similarly to how models of computation existed before computers did, so did ways of examining theories of life. The game of life was 

\subsection{So... Whats the Big Deal?}
\section{Definitions, Theorems, and other Important Terminology}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[] \textbf{GOALS FOR SUB SECT}
  \item Explain the common patters / life forms that can be found in the game
  \item Explain the three patterns we will be examining (Still life, ociliator, and spaceship)
  \item Add images to these 
  \item Explain other relevant mathematical terminology / information that's worth introducing 

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{What about Complexity?}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[] \textbf{GOALS FOR SUB SECT}
  \item More of an intro sub section connecting the game to complexity analysis  
  \item This is where we'll define important compelexity classes like NP
  \item outline any other important info we want to outline before getting into more gritty / mathy stuff

\subsection{Definitions and Theorems}
You can organize your write-up into both sections and subsections. There are also subsubsections, if you really want them. 

If we want to present a theorem, lemma, corollary, etcetera, we enter into the appropriate environment, and then follow it up with the proof via a proof environment, like so:

\begin{theorem}
    $\mathbf{P} = \mathbf{NP}$
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    It came to me in a dream.
\end{proof}

As you can see, theorems, lemmas and so forth are automatically numbered based on your sections and subsections. 

I personally like to present definitions within a theorem environment, for easy referencing.
\begin{definition}\label{NC}
    $\mathbf{NC}$ (standing for \emph{not cool}) is the set of decision problems that I personally dislike. 
\end{definition}

By using the \emph{label} command, you can reference anything you want later using the \emph{ref} command, e.g. if we consult definition \ref{NC} we can see...

\subsection{Citations and Bibliography}

Citations are stored in the bibliography.bib file. To show you an example, I've added the textbook linked on canvas. You can cite an entry in the bibliography using the cite command. E.g. according to chapter 7 of 

There are plenty of online tools for automatically generating bibtex entries. Usually these can be directly copied from the publisher page for a paper. The references will be automatically generated when you compile. Be aware that \emph{references will only be added for the entries of your bibliography that you actually cite}. If I did not cite the textbook in this file, it would not appear as a reference. Don't let this confuse you!
